Collection of scripts used to build cluster.

Our cluster is based on RockyLinux8.6 + OpenHPC package
For RockyLinux, we used the DVD iso downloaded from: https://rockylinux.org/zh_TW/download
And we basically follow the installation guild of OpenHPC at: https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/2.X
Another tutorial is at: https://linux.onlinedoc.tw/2017/07/centos-rhel7-openhpc.html
