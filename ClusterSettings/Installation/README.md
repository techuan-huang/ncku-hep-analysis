Collection of scripts used to build cluster.

Our cluster is based on RockyLinux8.6 + OpenHPC package.

- For RockyLinux, we used the DVD iso downloaded from: https://rockylinux.org/zh_TW/download
 - https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/8/isos/x86_64/Rocky-8.6-x86_64-dvd1.iso
- And we basically follow the installation guild of OpenHPC at: https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/2.X
- Another tutorial is at: https://linux.onlinedoc.tw/2017/07/centos-rhel7-openhpc.html
- All the commands are collected in RockyOpenHPC.sh
